# War Card Game

This is a C# version of the classic card game called War. The cards are shuffled before being added to the player's deck. You see each player's card for every round. The total rounds are recorded at the end.

## How to Play

This is a 2-player game. The deck is shuffled and dealt to each person. Both players have their decks facing down and flip the top card to reveal the face value. The player with the higher card value takes the cards and add it to the bottom of their deck. In case of a tie where both cards have the same value, "war" is declared by putting 3 cards face down and revealing the 4th card and the player with higher card wins all those cards.

## How to Win

The first person to have the entire deck in hand wins!
